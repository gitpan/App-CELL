MIGHT IMPLEMENT SOMEDAY
20140516 get App::CELL to pass CPAN Testers (100%) on all Perls back to 5.10.0
20140526 release.sh process multiple arguments (ATM it takes only one)
20140529 Status.pm: 'ok' and 'not_ok' methods are almost identical - use a
         "subroutine factory" to generate them
20140529 Status.pm: change name of 'log' to 'dump_to_log'
20140529 Status.pm: add 'dump_to_fd' that takes STDOUT, STDERR, etc.
20140529 Guide.pm: write verbiage about how statuses are for handling
         expected errors. It's still OK to croak if something unexpected
         happens.


WILL PROBABLY NEVER IMPLEMENT
20140516 put meta, core, and site params directly in the module's symbol
         table like RT does it
20140524 add support for multiple sitedirs (multiple calls to Load->init)


WILL NEVER IMPLEMENT
20140524 add 'testing' mode to Load->init (prefix all paths, e.g., with 
         '/tmp')
